# Shannara Taylor Parkins - @ShannaraTP

Hi, I am Shannara and I work as a postdoctoral researcher at the Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Biosustainability (DTU Biosustain), where I focus on the development of microbial cell factories for biosustainable production of industrially relevant compounds. I apply my expertise in proteomics and Bayesian metabolic modelling to both experimental and computational work in Escherichia coli, using cutting-edge techniques and tools. To tackle todayâ€™s challenges, I am passionate about using biological data combined with data science to provide solutions and I aim to contribute to this field with my research and data analysis skills.
